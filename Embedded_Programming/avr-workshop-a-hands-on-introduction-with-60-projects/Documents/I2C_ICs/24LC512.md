## Basics of I²C Communication

- **Master** (e.g., ATMega328P) controls clock and initiates communication.  
- Multiple **slaves** share the bus, each identified by a **7-bit address**.  
- Every I²C transaction starts with a **START** condition.  
- Master sends an **8-bit control byte**:  
  - 7 bits: slave address  
  - 1 bit: R/W flag (0 = write, 1 = read)  
- Data bytes follow, ending with a **STOP** condition.

## 1. Slave Address (Used to Select the Chip)

#### The 24LC512 Slave Address Format

The **fixed part** of the 24LC512's 7-bit slave address is:

```
1 0 1 0
```

This 4-bit prefix identifies the device as an EEPROM.

The **last 3 bits** are set by the hardware pins A2, A1, and A0:

| Pin | Connected to | Corresponding bit value |
|-----|--------------|------------------------|
| A2  | GND or VCC   | 0 or 1                 |
| A1  | GND or VCC   | 0 or 1                 |
| A0  | GND or VCC   | 0 or 1                 |



Examples of Slave Addresses for Different A2:A1:A0 Settings

| A2 | A1 | A0 | Binary 7-bit Address  | Hex (7-bit) | Notes                       |
|----|----|----|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 1010 000 (0b1010000)  | 0x50        | All pins grounded (default)  |
| 0  | 0  | 1  | 1010 001 (0b1010001)  | 0x51        | A0 tied to VCC               |
| 0  | 1  | 0  | 1010 010 (0b1010010)  | 0x52        | A1 tied to VCC               |
| 1  | 0  | 0  | 1011 000 (0b1011000)  | 0x58        | A2 tied to VCC               |
| 1  | 1  | 1  | 1010 111 (0b1010111)  | 0x57        | All three pins tied to VCC  |

> **You can connect up to 8 devices on the same bus** by setting different combinations of A2, A1, and A0 pins.



#### Forming the Control Byte (7-bit Address + R/W Bit)

I²C requires an 8-bit **control byte** for addressing:

```
[7-bit Slave Address] [R/W bit]
```

- The **7-bit slave address** is shifted left by 1 bit.  
- The **least significant bit** is the R/W bit (0 = write, 1 = read).

## 2. Memory Address (Inside the EEPROM)

- The 24LC512 has **64 KB of memory** → addresses from `0x0000` to `0xFFFF`.  
- Requires **16 bits** (2 bytes) to specify the memory location.  
- Master sends **High byte** first, then **Low byte**.



### Step-by-Step Communication Example

Writing One Byte: Write `0xAB` to `0x1234`

| Step | Action                           | Description                                |
|-------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Send `START` condition          | Begin communication                         |
| 2     | Send control byte `0xA0`        | Select slave at `0x50` in **write mode**   |
| 3     | Send memory high byte `0x12`    | Select high byte of address `0x1234`       |
| 4     | Send memory low byte `0x34`     | Select low byte of address `0x1234`        |
| 5     | Send data byte `0xAB`           | Write this data to the selected address    |
| 6     | Send `STOP` condition           | End communication                           |
| 7     | Wait ~5ms                      | EEPROM internal write delay                 |



Reading One Byte: Read from `0x1234`

| Step | Action                           | Description                              |
|-------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Send `START`                   | Begin communication                       |
| 2     | Send control byte `0xA0`       | Select slave at `0x50` **write mode**    |
| 3     | Send memory high byte `0x12`   | Select high byte of address               |
| 4     | Send memory low byte `0x34`    | Select low byte of address                |
| 5     | Send `REPEATED START`          | Restart without releasing the bus         |
| 6     | Send control byte `0xA1`       | Select slave at `0x50` **read mode**     |
| 7     | Read 1 byte from slave         | Receive data byte from EEPROM             |
| 8     | Send NACK + STOP               | End communication                         |



### Read/Write Mode for Example Slave Address = 0x50

Understanding the Formula: `0x50 << 1 | 1 = 0xA1`

1. Start with the 7-bit slave address `0x50`:
   - Hexadecimal: `0x50`  
   - Binary (7 bits): `1010000` 
   This is the fixed device address with A2:A1:A0 pins all tied to GND.

2. Shift Left by 1 Bit (`0x50 << 1`): 
   Shifting left by 1 bit means moving all bits one position to the left, inserting a `0` in the least significant bit (rightmost position). This operation makes space for the R/W bit at the least significant bit position.

   - Binary before shift: `0101 0000` (7 bits)  
   - After left shift by 1: `1010 0000` (8 bits)  
   - In hex: `0xA0`

   Explanation:  
   - Before shift, `0x50` represents the 7-bit address.  
   - After shift, the 7 bits move to bits 7 down to 1 in the new byte, bit 0 is free.

3. Add the R/W Bit Using Bitwise OR (`| 1`): 
   
   - The read/write bit is the least significant bit (bit 0) of the control byte.  
   - `0` means **write mode** (master writing data to slave).  
   - `1` means **read mode** (master reading data from slave).
   
   For **read mode**, we set this bit to `1`:  
   ```
   0xA0 (binary 10100000) | 0x01 (binary 00000001) = 0xA1 (binary 10100001)
   ```
   
   For **write mode**, this bit remains `0`:  
   ```
   0xA0 (binary 10100000) | 0x00 = 0xA0 (binary 10100000)
   ```
   
4. **Final Control Bytes:**  
   - **Write mode control byte:** `0xA0` (binary `10100000`)  
   - **Read mode control byte:**  `0xA1` (binary `10100001`)



### Why Shift and Add?

- The 7-bit slave address must occupy bits 7 through 1 in the control byte.  
- The least significant bit (bit 0) of the control byte specifies the operation (R/W).  
- Shifting left by 1 moves the 7-bit address into its proper position, and then bitwise OR with `0` or `1` sets the operation bit.
