# Generate PWM

in this microcontroller we have 6 pins capable of generating `PWM`. these are as follow:

| Port Name | Pin Number | Duty Cycle Register |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| PD6       | 12         | OCR0A               |
| PD5       | 11         | OCR0B               |
| PB1       | 15         | OCR1A               |
| PB2       | 16         | OCR1B               |
| PB3       | 17         | OCR2A               |
| PD3       | 5          | OCR2B               |
